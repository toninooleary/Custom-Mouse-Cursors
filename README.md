 Mouse cursors created using Aseprite

# Setup a custom cursor

## Step 1
- Download the cursor(s) you want to use
- Navigate to C:\Windows\Cursors
- Drop cursor files into the directory
(Without this cursors will reset on machine start up)

## Step 2
- Open settings and navigate to Mouse -> Additional Mouse Settings
- Select the pointers tab, press browse and select the cursor you want to use (the cursor you added to C:\Windows\Cursors should be visible)
- Once all cursors have been set, you can press save as to create a 'scheme' (cursor preset)
